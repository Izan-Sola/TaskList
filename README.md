Sooo i studied a middle grade on microinformatic systems and network and rn im doing practices on a workplace, doing a web for their wifi hotspot and I'm rlly enjoying programming. I have always been interested in programming in general, was interested on game programming and even tho i like it is not rlly my thing, i prefer to play games than to make them lol. But i rlly like js (u can see i uploaded something like +2 years ago, pretty simple and pretty bad lol) but never really commited to really learning it more than doing random things sometimes. And well now aswell as doing the web for the job i decided to start a project by myself of doing a tasklist. But i dont want it to be just a simple task list in which you add and remove tasks and thats it. I want it to look good and to add more features. Rn im working on adding a calendary (will prolly import one i saw for free and edit it to fit the page style) and i will make so you have a different tasklist for each month, and you can select a day clicking on it and then when you add a task it will look something like:

Friday 10 April:
------------------
Task.....
  - SubTask
  - SubTask
------------------
Also instead of a fixated list of tasks like it is rn, each task will we a draggable element.

Soooo yeah, thats all atm.
